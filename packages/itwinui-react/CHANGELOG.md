# Changelog

## 3.2.1

### Patch Changes

- [#1760](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1760): Fixed `ComboBox` to correctly merge `inputProps.style` with internal styles.

## 3.2.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1734](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1734): `ThemeProvider` will now attempt to automatically load `styles.css` if using `theme="inherit"` (or `includeCss` if using other themes).

  While applications are still advised to manually import `styles.css`, this new behavior is intended to ease the migration for applications that may be using an older version of iTwinUI but want to consume dependencies that rely on iTwinUI v3.

- [#1744](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1744): `@itwin/itwinui-illustrations-react` has been made a direct dependency again, to avoid issues with bundlers attempting to bundle it even if `ErrorPage` is not used anywhere.

### Patch Changes

- [#1742](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1742): Fixed `ErrorPage` to correctly lazy import from `@itwin/itwinui-illustrations-react`.

## 3.1.2

### Patch Changes

### Patch Changes

- [#1738](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1738): Added missing `sideEffects` to prevent tree-shaking `styles.css` in webpack.

## 3.1.0

### Minor Changes

- [#1707](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1707): `FileUpload`'s `onFileDropped` prop will now expose the underlying drop event as the second argument. This can be useful for accessing information about the directory structure.
- [#1709](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1709): `IconButton`s inside a vertical `ButtonGroup` will now show tooltips on the right side by default, to avoid obscuring adjacent buttons in the group. The behavior of these tooltips can also be customized using the new `labelProps` prop, which can contain `labelProps.placement`, etc.

### Patch Changes

Welcome to the v3 release of `@itwin/itwinui-react`. ðŸŽ‰

This release includes a few breaking changes which have been briefly listed below. For more details, see the [v3 migration guide](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/wiki/iTwinUI-react-v3-migration-guide).

### Major Changes

- [#1302](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1302): The dependencies on `@itwin/itwinui-css` and `@itwin/itwinui-variable` have been removed. This means `@itwin/itwinui-react` will expose its own stylesheet.
- [#1322](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1322): All css imports within components have been removed. `@itwin/itwinui-react/styles.css` must now be manually imported at the entrypoint.
- [#1302](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1302): All elements have had their class names changed to prevent conflict with older versions. It is strongly recommended to switch these internal classes with your own classes or data attributes.
- [#1389](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1389): iTwinUI now correctly supports both ESM and CJS environments.
- [#1583](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1583): Bumped minimum required react version to 17. If you're still on react 16, please update to react 17 (which has no breaking changes).
- [#1514](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1514): Table now has better type support. Types must now be imported from `@itwin/itwinui-react/react-table` instead of from `@types/react-table`.
- [#1346](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1346): The build now targets `es2020` instead of `es2018`.
- [#1311](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1311), [#1506](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1506): Replaced `tippy.js` with `floating-ui` in all popover-based components. While the basic usage is unchanged, all advanced props from tippy are no longer available. Components affected: Select, ComboBox, DropdownMenu, DropdownButton, SplitButton.
- [#1351](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1351): `toaster` import has been removed and replaced with `useToaster` which returns a toaster object with the same API.
- [#1265](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1265): Removed the deprecated `useTheme` hook. `<ThemeProvider>` is now always required to be wrapped around all iTwinUI components.
- [#1433](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1433): Updated `exports` to prevent importing internal utilities.
- [#1298](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1298): `Props` types will no longer be exported for any component. Use `React.ComponentProps` instead.
- [#1400](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1400): `ErrorPage` will now dynamically import illustrations. The peer dependency on `@itwin/itwinui-illustrations-react` will need to be manually installed if using `ErrorPage`.
- [#1478](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1478): ThemeProvider now defaults the `theme` value to `"inherit"` and falls back to `"light"` there is no parent theme found. Also the inherit behavior has been made more resilient for cases where react context fails.
- [#1269](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1269): All dialog variants have `flex` applied by default. This means the content should be wrapped with `Dialog.Content` or `ModalContent` for optimal layout.
- [#1300](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1300): `modalRootId` and `ownerDocument` props have been removed from `Modal`, in favor of the new `portal` prop (also available in `Dialog`).
- [#1461](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1461): Changed disabled button behavior to make them focusable and use `aria-disabled` instead of `disabled` attribute.
- [#1565](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1565): Removed `Menu` component. Use `DropdownMenu` instead.
- [#1406](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1406): Removed `setFocus` prop from Checkbox, ColorPicker, ComboBox, Input, LabeledInput, LabeledTextarea, Radio, RadioTile, Select, Slider, ToggleSwitch. Instead, `ref` can be used to focus the element.

- [#1544](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1544): Removed `iconDisplayStyle` prop from `LabeledInput` and `LabeledTextarea` components. `svgIcon` is now added inline. Users must use `StatusMessage` to add custom icon to the message.
- [#1626](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1626): Improved carousel accessibility and changed the markup so that the dots are present before the slides.
- [#1278](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1278): Adjusted calculations in ButtonGroup's `overflowButton` callback, so that it respects `overflowPlacement` and considers the presence of the overflowButton itself.
- [#1355](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1355): Removed `inputStyle` and `inputClassName` props from `LabeledInput`; style and className props are being passed down to input.

- [#1409](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1409): `RadioTile`'s top-level `className` and `style` props will now be applied on the `<input>` element instead of the wrapper.
- [#1458](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1458): `SideNavButton`'s top-level props (className, style, etc) are now passed to the button instead of to the wrapper.
- [#1435](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1435): `SplitButton`'s top-level props (className, style, etc) are now passed to the button instead of the component wrapper.
- [#1304](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1304): Instead of cloning passed icons to set classes on them, the classes will now be set on a wrapping element. Affected components: `Header`, `Select`, `MenuItem`, `RadioTile`, `Tabs`, `Tile`, `ToggleSwitch`, `TreeNode`, `InputContainer` (and all input variants).
- [#1469](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/pull/1469): Updated internal DOM structure in Slider.
