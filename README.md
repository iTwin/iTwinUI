<p align="center">An open-source design system that helps us build a unified web experience.</p>

iTwinUI is a design system for building beautiful and well working web UI components within Bentley Systems & iTwin.js applications. It supports light and dark color schemes and also comes with high contrast versions of both.

iTwinUI consists of the following packages:

- [`@itwin/itwinui-css`](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/blob/main/packages/itwinui-css/README.md) - the CSS for every component as well as some global styles
- [`@itwin/itwinui-variables`](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/blob/main/packages/itwinui-variables/README.md) - CSS variables for iTwinUI's design tokens
- [`@itwin/itwinui-react`](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/blob/main/packages/itwinui-react/README.md) - react components that consume `@itwin/itwinui-css`

Check out the README for each of those packages for more details on how to use them.
