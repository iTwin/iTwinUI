## Appearance

Each type of error page should be designed based on what you wish to tell the user about that error. First off, the error code, along with a short description, should be displayed so the user can identify the source of the problem. Then, informative text, accompanied with images that can be informative as well and/or decorative to aid the user moving onto the next step. The error illustration should take up no more than â…“ of the screen width.

## Usage

Error pages come with their own error and should not be mixed and matched to avoid confusion from one error to another. Here are a few of the error pages you can use.

### Status

`NotificationMarker`s can have `primary` (default), `positive`, `warning`, `negative`, or `white` statuses. The `white` status is used on colored backgrounds, such as the high visibility or the call-to-action button.

<LiveExample src='NonIdealState.unauthorized.jsx' truncate={false}>
  <AllExamples.NonIdealStateUnauthorizedExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Controlled

The `enabled` prop can be used to programatically show or hide the notification marker.

### Pulsing

To give a higher important to the notification, you can use the `pulsing` prop to show a pulse effect around the marker.

**NOTE**: This prop should be used sparingly as it can be distracting to the user.
