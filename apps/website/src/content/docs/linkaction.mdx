`LinkAction` is a utility component that makes it easier to create accessible [block links](https://adrianroselli.com/2020/02/block-links-cards-clickable-regions-etc.html) (or buttons).

<LiveExample src='LinkAction.main.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.LinkActionMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

This component is useful in a wide range of situations when you need to increase the clickable area of an element (e.g. a card, a list item, etc.) without compromising semantics. This means you can keep the link text concise and still make the entire area clickable, even if it includes other elements or extra padding.

`LinkAction` is used internally in [`Tile`](tile#actionable) and [`ListItem`](list#with-listitemaction) components, and is also available for use in external components.

## Usage

This component consists of two parts:

1. `LinkBox`: A wrapper component that makes the entire area clickable.
2. `LinkAction`: The actual link (or button) inside the wrapper.

```jsx
<LinkBox>
  <LinkAction href='https://www.example.com'>Click me</LinkAction>
  <p>Content outside the link.</p>
</LinkBox>
```

Similar to the [`Anchor`](anchor) component, `LinkAction` supports the polymorphic `as` prop, which can be used to render a different link component (e.g. from a client-side router) or a `"button"` (e.g. when you want to trigger an action within the same page, rather than a page navigation).

## Technical explanation

The implementation of this component is based on [the pseudo-content trick](https://inclusive-components.design/cards/#thepseudocontenttrick), which makes the `LinkAction`'s `::after` pseudo-element expand to fill up all the available space of the `LinkBox` component. A side-effect of this is that the text inside the `LinkBox` will not be selectable, but this is usually not a problem.

If your container includes other elements that should be clickable, you can set `position: relative` on them or give them a higher z-index. This will make them appear on top of the pseudo-element and therefore receive the click event instead of the primary `LinkAction`.

```jsx
<LinkBox>
  <LinkAction href='#'>Primary link</LinkAction>

  <a href='#' style={{ position: 'relative' }}>
    Secondary link
  </a>
</LinkBox>
```
