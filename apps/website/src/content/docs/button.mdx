<LiveExample src='Button.main.jsx'>

</LiveExample>

Buttons have states and events and should be used when a form is submitted or where the button represents a clear call to action on a page.
In some cases, buttons can also be used in place of href links to draw special attention to that action.

## Usage

The default button should be used in most circumstances. If you are unsure as to what button to use, use this button!

<LiveExample src='Button.default.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ButtonDefaultExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### High visibility

This is the button to emphasize an action applicable to an area of the page or a [dialog](dialog). High visibility buttons are used to draw the user’s attention to the main action of the page.
There should only be one high visibility button per area of the user interface.

<LiveExample src='Button.highvisibility.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ButtonHighVisibilityExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Call-to-action

The call-to-action button, also referred to as the CTA, is the button that is used for most full page layouts and whole-page overlays (think Next in [stepper](stepper) interactions). This is the biggest and most noticeable button.
One call-to-action button per visible page is the rule. Treat it as a large, “CLICK HERE” guide for the user.

<LiveExample src='Button.cta.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ButtonCTAExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Borderless

The borderless button is useful in tighter areas where using a default button would visibly cause too many boxes.

<LiveExample src='Button.borderless.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ButtonBorderlessExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The borderless button is often used by actionable icons in relation to another component.
They are commonly used within [table](table) rows and widgets.

### Size

There are 3 different sizes available, which can be applied to any button. The medium size is a default and should always be the first choice, unless there are good reasons to use the small or large version.

<LiveExample src='Button.size.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ButtonSizeExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Stretched

To make a button stretch to the full width of its parent, use the `stretched` prop.

```jsx
<Button stretched>Sign in</Button>
```

This is useful in narrow containers and mobile views. Don't overuse this!

## Button props

<PropsTable path='@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Buttons/Button.d.ts' />

## SplitButton

Pressing the left side of this button will commit the action. Pressing the right side of the button will open a menu.

<LiveExample src='SplitButton.main.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.SplitButtonMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Props

<PropsTable path='@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Buttons/SplitButton.d.ts' />

## DropdownButton

Pressing this button will always open a menu. Upon selecting an option from the menu, the action immediately takes place. The menu button should only be styled as default buttons and borderless buttons.

<LiveExample src='DropdownButton.main.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.DropdownButtonMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Props

<PropsTable path='@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Buttons/DropdownButton.d.ts' />

## IconButton

Icon button gives the icon the correct styling as well as adds some clickable padding within the button, ensuring icons meet the necessary touch target size.

Make sure to provide a short `label` that describes the action the button will perform. This label will be shown in a tooltip and also exposed to assistive technologies.

<LiveExample src='IconButton.main.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.IconButtonMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Props

<PropsTable path='@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Buttons/IconButton.d.ts' />

## IdeasButton

The Ideas button is unique and should only be used under certain circumstances. You will need to perform an audit of your application to ensure that the feedback button does not cover / obscure any tools.

<LiveExample src='IdeasButton.main.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.IdeasButtonMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

If the button does obscure anything important, we suggest adding empty space at the bottom of the page so the user can scroll far enough down that the button doesn’t overlap the underlying tools.

### Props

<PropsTable path='@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Buttons/IdeasButton.d.ts' />

## Usage guidelines

### Style types

- Use default button just about everywhere.
- One high visibility button per section such as within a [dialog](dialog), or above a [table](table).
- One call-to-action button on a page at a time, and it should always appear within a dedicated page footer.
- Borderless buttons should be used in places where a default and icon button could cause too much visual clutter.
- Icon buttons should not have high visibility or call-to-action styletypes.

### Labels

Strive for a single action word with a well-understood meaning such as a verb. Remember that all labels will need translation, so if the button absolutely requires a longer string, adhere to the _twentycharacterlimit_ rule.

### Icon and label buttons

To reinforce the meaning of a button it can be useful to display both an icon and a label. Use this option sparingly, and reserve if for the most important / frequently used buttons only. If you are unsure if an icon should be used, probably it shouldn’t.
