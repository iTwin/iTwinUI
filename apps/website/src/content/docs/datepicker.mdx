When a user needs to schedule deadlines, timeframes, or for age verification purposes, we provide them with a date picker. It behaves much like a select menu. We currently have three different types of date pickers.

## Usage

The `DatePicker` component allows the user to pick a date from the calendar and skip a month at a time.

This component is recommended to be used inside the [`Popover`](popover) component, which takes care for placement, collision handling, focus management, outside clicks, and other interaction details.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.basic.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerBasicExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

If you would rather see an example of the date picker being used on its own, look at the [standalone usage](#standalone-usage).

**Note**: The `showDatesOutsideMonth` prop is recommended to be set to `false`, so that dates that are not in the currently selected month are not displayed. Currently, this prop defaults to `true` for backwards compatibility reasons.

### Localized

You are able to create a localized version of the date picker that uses local names for week days and months.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.localized.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerLocalizedExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Date + time selection

If you need to include the time, there are multiple ways to do so. Below is the default variant, which uses twenty-four hour time.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.withtime.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerWithTimeExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

And here is the variant that uses twelve-hour time with meridiem:

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.withcombinedtime.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerWithCombinedTimeExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Date range

There may be some cases where you need to display a range of dates. When this occurs, the selection box spans the entirety of the date range.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.daterange.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerDateRangeExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Some dates disabled

You might also need to have certain dates disabled, in case the range of dates that can be selected for your purpose is limited.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.datesdisabled.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerDatesDisabledExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Year skipping

To improve user experience, date pickers support year skipping buttons. Clicking on the double chevron icon will move the calendar a full year forward or back.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.withyear.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerWithYearExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Standalone usage

The `DatePicker` does not always need to be used within its own popover. You can instead display it as part of a larger interface containing interconnected controls.

You can set `applyBackground={false}` to make the `DatePicker` blend into its surroundings. This is useful when the surrounding UI already brings its own background-color and border.

<LiveExample src='DatePicker.menu.jsx' truncate={true}>
  <AllExamples.DatePickerMenuExample client:load />
</LiveExample>
