## Usage

By default, The `<Kbd>` component renders as a `<kbd>` HTML element. To learn more about the default DOM element refer to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd).

The `<KbdKeys` enum provides a convenient set of constants for common keyboard keys such as KbdKeys.Command, KbdKeys.Shift and many others.
