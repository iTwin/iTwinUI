## For developers

### Installation

iTwinUI is offered primarily as a set of React components that work with React v17 and above. Start by installing `@itwin/itwinui-react` using your package manager of choice.

```shell
npm add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

### Setup

Wrap your application entrypoint in `ThemeProvider` and import `styles.css`.

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';
import '@itwin/itwinui-react/styles.css';

export default function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeProvider>
      <>{/* Your components go here. */}</>
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

For more details, check out the [`ThemeProvider` documentation](/docs/themeprovider).

### Usage

After setting up ThemeProvider and styles, you can start using the [components](/docs/components) you want by importing them from the top-level `@itwin/itwinui-react` module.

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const Page = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

### Versioning

This documentation is for the latest version of iTwinUI (v3). If you're using an older version of iTwinUI, we highly recommend upgrading (see [migration guide](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/wiki/iTwinUI-react-v3-migration-guide)). In the meantime, you might find these links useful:

## For designers

### UI kit

Download the iTwinUI design kits and start creating experiences. These UI kits are available via [the iTwinUI Figma Community page](https://www.figma.com/@itwinui).

### Fonts

iTwinUI uses the Noto Sans font family, created in collaboration by Adobe and Google. We suggest these two methods of downloading the font family:

- If you use Adobe Creative Cloud, you can sync the fonts using [Adobe Fonts](https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/noto-sans).
- If you do not use Adobe Creative Cloud, you can download the files from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Sans).
