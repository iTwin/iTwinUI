A tree can be used to organize data in an application specific way, or it can be used to sort, filter, group, or search data as the user deems appropriate. Each line of data level may begin with an eye icon for toggling its visibility. In this context, this icon is called specialty checkbox.

## Size

There are 2 different sizes available, which can be applied to any tree. The medium size is a default and should always be the first choice, unless there are good reasons to use the small version.
