A tree can be used to organize data in an application specific way, or it can be used to sort, filter, group, or search data as the user deems appropriate. Each line of data level may begin with an eye icon for toggling its visibility. In this context, this icon is called specialty checkbox.

## Size

There are 2 different sizes available. The default size should suffice for most cases. When a smaller version of the tree is needed, use `size="small"`.
