The alert message must be concise, it is recommended to have no more than 256 characters. If you need to provide additional information, consider using an optional [hyperlink](#alertaction) at the end of the alert message to explain more on a new page. You may also include an optional close icon (a close icon is mandatory for [sticky](#sticky-alert) alerts).
Additionally it's important to note that alerts are intended to inform users of information that is unrelated to their recent actions. Examples of alerts include announcing new product features or notifying the user of scheduled server maintenance and downtime. If you need to alert the user because of something they did, consider using a [toast](toast) notification or an inline message.

## Usage

### Composition API

You can build Alerts with sub-components that are fully customizable.

```tsx
<Alert.Wrapper type='positive'>
  <Alert.Icon />
  <Alert.Message>
    This is an alert
    <Alert.Action onClick={() => console.log('Clicked more info!')}>Learn more</Alert.Action>
  </Alert.Message>
  <Alert.CloseButton onClick={() => console.log('CLOSED')} />
</Alert.Wrapper>
```

### Legacy API

Alternatively, you can use `Alert` directly, without any subcomponents. Although this pattern can suffice for simple cases, we strongly recommend using composition API for more flexibility. Some of the legacy props like `clickableText`/`clickableTextProps` may be removed in the future, as they encourage bad patterns.

The following code is equivalent to the [composition example](#composition-api) above:

```tsx
<Alert
  type='positive'
  clickableText='Learn More'
  onClose={() => console.log('CLOSED')}
  clickableTextProps={{
    onClick={() => console.log('Clicked more info!')},
  }}
></Alert>
```

### `<Alert.Action>`

The `Alert.Action` subcomponent can be used to provide additional information that may not fit the main message. Its behavior can be adjusted to navigate to another page, or perform an action on the same page (such as showing a dialog).

- When `href` is passed, it behaves like a regular anchor link.
- when `onClick` is passed, it behaves as a normal button.

## Statuses

By default, Alerts will use `type='informational'`. The `type` prop can be changed to a specific status.

- `'positive'`: indication of a task that has been successfully completed.
- `'warning'`: requires attention but does not result in any immediate disruption.
- `'negative'`: signify system outages or failures.

  <AllExamples.AlertTypesExample client:load />

## Sticky Alert

Use the `isSticky` prop to fix an alert at the top of a user's screen even if they scroll down the page. It's important to note that sticky alerts must always be dismissible (using the close button). Additionally, the alert will appear above all other UI elements except for toast notifications and modals.

<LiveExample src='Alert.sticky.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.AlertStickyExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

It is up to the development team wether or not the sticky alert should push the rest of the content down or not.
