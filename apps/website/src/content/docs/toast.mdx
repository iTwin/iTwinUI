## Usage

Before triggering a toast, the toaster needs to be initialized using the `useToaster` hook. This hook returns an object which provides various methods for triggering the toast and changing the toaster settings.

<LiveExample src='Toast.main.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

{/* TODO: Re-add removed working to say that it accepts a second param containing an options object. And explain maybe more about that object. */}

### Status

There are four available statuses that comes with toast message:

- `positive`
- `negative`
- `warning`
- `informational`

<LiveExample src='Toast.status.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastStatusExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Link

{/* TODO: No component is there. So, no link prop. Need to rephrase that we can pass it as an option in the second param. The second param is called options. */}

The toast notification can come with a hyperlink using the `link` prop. You can utilize this prop to take further action directly from the toast, such as navigating to another page or triggering a specific function.

<LiveExample src='Toast.link.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastLinkExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Settings

The object returned by `useToaster` also provides a `setSettings` method, which can be used to customize the `placement` and `order` of toasts.

`placement` supports the following values:

- `"top"` (default)
- `"top-start"`
- `"top-end"`
- `"bottom"`
- `"bottom-start"`
- `"bottom-end"`

`"start"` indicates the left side of viewport, while `"end"` represents the right side.

`order` supports the following values:

- `"auto"` (default)
- `"descending"`
- `"ascending"`

When set to `"descending"`, the most recent toasts are on top. When set to `"ascending"`, the most recent toasts are on bottom. When set to `"auto"`, it will behave like `"descending"` when `placement` is set to a `-top` value, otherwise `"ascending"`.

<LiveExample src='Toast.positioning.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastPositioningExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Closing toasts

When setting the `hasCloseButton` to `true`, each toast will be displayed with a close button, which allows you to close the toast manually. Additionally, to implement further actions upon each toast closing or chain after one another to display multiple messages, you can retrieve the `close()` function returned from the status method.

<LiveExample src='Toast.closeIndividual.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastCloseIndividualExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

Closing also depends on which type of toast you are using, without the use of `hasCloseButton`. Persisting toasts will not be closed automatically, and will contain a close button. Temporary toasts will automatically close after 7 seconds and will not contain a close button. The type of toasts can be specified by passing either `"persisting"` or `"temporary"` into the `type` option.

<LiveExample src='Toast.type.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastTypeExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

{/* TODO: Describe where closeAll comes from */}

To close all toasters on viewport at once, use `closeAll()`.

{/* TODO: Change example so that the animation is more obvious. Position may be top right. */}

<LiveExample src='Toast.closeAll.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastCloseAllExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The `animateOutTo` prop allows you to control the direction to which the toast animates out when closing. Specifically, it helps determine an "anchor" element that the toast will go towards when it is dismissed by pointing to a ref passed into that element.

<LiveExample src='Toast.anchorToButton.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.ToastAnchorToButtonExample client:load />
</LiveExample>
