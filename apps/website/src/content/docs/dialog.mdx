A dialog informs users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks. Dialogs appear in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

## Dialog VS Modal

The terms dialog and modal are often used interchangeably. Within iTwinUI we differentiate the two terms like so:

- Non-modal dialog: a non-modal dialog is the box of content that appears above the rest of the page content. The user can still interact with the page content.
- Modal dialog: a modal dialog is the combination of a dialog with a backdrop that appears above the rest of the page content. This backdrop disables interaction with the page content until the dialog is dismissed.

  <AllExamples.DialogModalExample client:load />

## Variants

### Dismissible

A dismissible dialog contains information that is not required to complete before being able to proceed.

<LiveExample src='Dialog.dismissible.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.DialogDismissibleExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The dialog can be dismissed multiple different ways:

- Clicking one of the action buttons.
- Clicking on “X” button.
- Pressing the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key on your keyboard.
- Clicking outside the dialog window.

The “X” icon bears the borderless button style which appears on cursor hover.

### Non-dismissible

A non dismissible dialog contains important information that must be completed. The only way to dismiss a non dismissible dialog is by completing the action.

<LiveExample src='Dialog.nondismissible.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.DialogNonDismissibleExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Draggable

These dialogs have a defined header that can be clicked and moved around the screen at the user’s leisure, just like a browser window. This dialog can also be resized.

<LiveExample src='Dialog.draggable.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.DialogDraggableExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Full page

A full page dialog appears on top of the content and occupy the entire page’s space. It is used primarily for pages where users will customize settings.

<LiveExample src='Dialog.fullpage.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.DialogFullPageExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The two buttons at the bottom right are always pinned in that same area, regardless of content. If there is more content than there is available space in the content area, a scrollbar can be included to make the content area scrollable.

As specified earlier, full-page dialogs will house various settings options as shown in the example below.

### Placement

Using the `placement` prop, a dialog can be adjusted to sit in one of the four corners of the page. Accepted values:

- `top-left`
- `top-right`
- `bottom-left`
- `bottom-right`

<LiveExample src='Dialog.placement.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.DialogPlacementExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Usage guidelines

Do:

- Use dialogs for important warnings, as a way to prevent or correct critical errors.
- Simplify the workflow. Use dialogs to ask for information that, when provided, could significantly lessen users’ work or effort.
- Limit the dialog to a single purpose. Limit the interaction to one, straightforward task.
- Keep it short. Be brief and concise in your content.
- Try displaying your information in a different way. See alternatives for more information.

Don't:

- Open a dialog from a dialog.
- Have multiple steps within a dialog.
- Present dialogs unless prompted by the user.
- Use a login within a dialog windows. You can’t link to them and some password managers can’t pre-fill them because the dialogs are hidden.

### Alternative options

Dialogs can easily be misused or overused. Here are some alternative options to consider:

- Present your content **inline** to be less disruptive, such as the message underneath an [input](input).
- Use **expanding elements** such as the [expandable block](expandableblock), [tooltips](tooltip), or the [information panel](informationpanel).
- Lead the user to a **different page** to isolate the interaction without losing access to functionality such as navigation.
- Inform the user with a **less intrusive notification** such as a [toast](toast). Toasts are less intrusive and are preferred to a dialog for interactions such as undoing an action.
