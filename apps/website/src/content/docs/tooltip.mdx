Make sure to read the [Accessibility](#accessibility) section for best practices before using tooltips.

## Usage

Wrap `Tooltip` around the element you want to use as the "trigger", and pass the tooltip text into the `content` prop.

<LiveExample src='Tooltip.main.jsx' truncate={false}>
  <AllExamples.TooltipMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

For everything to work correctly, the trigger element must:

- be an interactive element, for example, a `<button>`
- forward its ref
- delegate ([spread](https://react.dev/learn/passing-props-to-a-component#forwarding-props-with-the-jsx-spread-syntax)) any arbitrary props to the underlying DOM node

## Positioning

`Tooltip` handles positioning using an external library called [Floating UI](https://floating-ui.com/). To control which side the tooltip should be placed relative to its trigger, use the `placement` prop (which defaults to `"top"`). If enough space is not available, then it will automatically flip to the opposite side.

<LiveExample src='Tooltip.placement.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.TooltipPlacementExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

There are some advanced props available for more granular control over positioning, such as `autoUpdateOptions` and `middleware`. These are rarely needed in practice.

### Portals

It is important to know that before calculating the position, the tooltip gets [portaled](https://react.dev/reference/react-dom/createPortal) into the nearest [`ThemeProvider`](themeprovider). This is done to avoid [stacking context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_positioned_layout/Understanding_z-index/Stacking_context) issues in browsers where the [`popover` API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) is not supported. This portaling behavior can be controlled using the Tooltip's `portal` prop or the ThemeProvider's [`portalContainer`](themeprovider#portals) prop.

## Accessibility

`Tooltip` has a few built-in accessibility features to help satisfy [WCAG Success Criterion 1.4.13](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG22/Understanding/content-on-hover-or-focus.html).

- The tooltip will be shown when the trigger element is focused (e.g. using the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key).
- The tooltip can be dismissed using the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key.
- The content can be hovered over using a mouse pointer, instead of always disappearing when the pointer leaves the trigger element.
- For screen-reader support, the tooltip will be associated with the trigger element using [`aria-describedby`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Attributes/aria-describedby) by default. This behavior is controllable using the `ariaStrategy` prop.

### Best practices

- Tooltips should only be used to display supplemental information. Do **not** use tooltips to display critical information, or as a means to navigate an interface. Functionality of the product should **not** be dependent on the user reading tooltips.

- Tooltip content should consist of short plain text, up to 256 characters. Do **not** use content other than text, such as links, pictures, tables, etc. If you need to display more interactive content, consider using a [Popover](popover) instead.

- Tooltips should only be triggered by interactive elements, such as buttons, which can be focused using keyboard. Do **not** use tooltips for revealing truncated text and do **not** use plain icons as the trigger, as this pattern will not be accessible to keyboard users or screen-reader users.

- Touchscreen devices do not have a hover state. Be cautious when using tooltips, since there is no determined way of replacing tooltips on mobile devices or tablets.

## IconButtons

If you are using an [`IconButton`](button#iconbutton) as the trigger, you can pass the `label` prop to it, instead of wrapping it in a `Tooltip` component. This will automatically add the tooltip functionality to the button and handle some other accessibility considerations as well.

```tsx
<IconButton label='Edit'>
  <SvgEdit />
</IconButton>
```
