A radio button unlike checkboxes, permit selection of a single item within a set. Use radio buttons when the user is required to make a choice in a list with only one selection allowed. For example, a list where the user can only answer with yes or no.

A radio is not interchangeable with a [checkbox](checkbox). A radio must have at minimum 2 choice options and only one option can be checked. A checkbox, however, can have as many or as few items checked, and can be displayed as standalone or within a group of two or more.

### Statuses

If you ever need to display the status or severity of a single radio, you can apply a status on the radio. Before doing so, consider if using an [input group](inputgroup) with a status message makes more sense.
