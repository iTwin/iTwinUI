## Usage

When displaying texts with constrains on its width, the `MiddleTextTruncation` component can help by truncating long texts in the middle with an ellipsis (`"…"`). This ensures that the beginning and the end of the text remain visible.

<LiveExample src='MiddleTextTruncation.main.jsx' truncated={false}>
  <AllExamples.MiddleTextTruncationMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

For more examples, see [truncation on Select](/docs/select#truncation).

### Number of end characters

By default, six characters are left visible at the end of the truncated text. This ensures that important suffixes, such as file extensions or identifiers, remain visible. This number can be modified through the `endCharsCount` prop to suit user's specific needs.

<LiveExample src='MiddleTextTruncation.endCharsCount.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.MiddleTextTruncationEndCharsCountExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Customization

For further control over the rendering of the content, the `textRenderer` prop allows users to provide a custom rendering function. This function takes `originalText` and `truncatedText` as parameters and returns a `ReactNode`.

<LiveExample src='MiddleTextTruncation.customizeTruncation.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.MiddleTextTruncationCustomizationExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Accessibility

This component only truncates the content visually but leaves the full content in the accessibility tree. That way, users using assistive technologies can still have access to the full content which is consistent with the default overflow behavior.

However, this behavior may cause some inconvenience for screen-reader users, as the accessible text can become overly verbose. Thus, we recommend taking this into consideration when making planning the UX.
