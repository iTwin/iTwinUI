A series of selectable tile components that behave like [radio button](radio). You may include icons to help make each tile more identifiable.

<LiveExample src='RadioTile.main.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.RadioTileMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Usage

The example below is the condensed version of the radio tiles. They contain only a label and an icon (the icon is optional but recommended if using condensed). If you do not need descriptive text, go with the condensed radio tiles to save space.

Disabled radio tiles can coexit with active tile. A selected tile can also take on the disabled state.

<LiveExample src='RadioTile.color.jsx'>
  <AllExamples.RadioTileColorExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

Highly recommend one radio tile group per page as it is visually heavy and consumes a lot of space. For accessibility reasons, avoid displaying just an icon with no accompanying text.
