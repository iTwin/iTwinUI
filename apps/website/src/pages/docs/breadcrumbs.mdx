Breadcrumbs are a way of navigating a folder structure. Breadcrumbs should be used in conjunction with [tables](table), [tiles](tile), and website navigation. Once you start drilling in levels, the breadcrumbs are updated to navigate quickly between opened levels.

## Appearance

There are two styles of breadcrumbs supported:

### Links

The breadcrumb items can be displayed as clickable [anchor](anchor) links that the user can interact with to navigate back and forth. If clicking a breadcrumb item changes the URL, then using the link style is preferred.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeLink} />

### Buttons

The breadcrumb items can be displayed as [buttons](button). If clicking a breadcrumb item keeps the user on the same URL, but loads different content within the page, then using the button style is preferred.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeButton} />

## Usage

### Folder navigation

When navigating a directory, there are additional options to enhance the user's experience. Depending on how deep in the folder structure the user is, some breadcrumb items may need to be hidden or [truncated](#truncation). To make it easier to quickly navigate, we have 2 suggestions:

1. Place a dropdown button at the front of the breadcrumbs that displays the full path within a [dropdown menu](dropdownmenu).
2. When clicking on the current location, the breadcrumb can be replaced with an [input](input) displaying the full path. This allows for quick navigation or sharing the path with another user.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeFolder} />

### Truncation

Show as many previously accessed folders as possible so that users can quickly go back to an upper level. If all breadcrumb items can be shown without horizontal scrolling, show them all. Try to keep the first level - the root folder - always accessible. When you start truncating, start with the secondly accessed folder and work your way from there.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeTruncation} />

If the available space does not allow to display both the previous folder and current folder, start truncating text.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeExtremeTruncation} />
