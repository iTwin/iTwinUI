An alert is an element that notifies the user of something important that is not user initiated. If you need to alert the user because of something they did, consider using a [toast](toast) notification or an inline message. Instead, an alert is used to notify the user of something unrelated to what they just did. Examples of this might be announcing a new feature within the product, or alerting the user of scheduled server maintenance and downtime.

## Usage

The alert message must be concise, we recommend no more than 256 characters. If you feel the need to explain in further detail, you may use an optional [hyperlink](#alertaction) at the end of the alert message to explain more on a new page. You may also include an optional close icon (close icon is required for [sticky](#sticky) alerts).

### Composition API

You can build Alerts with sub-components that are fully customizable.

We provide:

- Alert.Wrapper
- Alert.Icon
- Alert.Message
- Alert.Action
- Alert.CloseButton

The type of alert can be specified by utilizing the `type` prop inside `<Alert.Wrapper>`. There are four distinct types of alerts that can be chosen from:

- positive : indication of a task or action that has been successfully completed. 
- warning : requires attention but do not result in any immediate disruption.
- negative : signify system outages or failures.
- informational : intended to provide users with updates on non-disruptive tasks or work.

<LiveExample src='Alert.types.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.AlertTypesExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

#### `<Alert.Action>`

By passing different props to `<Alert.Action>`, the user can interact with the alert to show additional information, redirected to other link or to close. A console message can be logged for event response.

- When `as='a'` and `href` props are set, it behaves like a regular anchor link.
- when `onClick` is passed, it behaves as a normal button.

### Legacy API

Alternatively, you can use Alerts directly with type, onClose and some deprecated props like clickableText and clickableTextProps. Although this pattern can suffice for simple cases, we strongly recommend using composition API for the best experience.

The following code is equivalent to the [composition example](#composition-api) above:

```tsx
<Alert
  type='positive'
  clickableText='More Info.'
  onClose={action('Close!')}
  clickableTextProps={{
    onClick: action('Clicked more info!'),
  }}
></Alert>
<Alert
  type='warning'
  clickableText='More Info.'
  onClose={action('Close!')}
  clickableTextProps={{
    onClick: action('Clicked more info!'),
  }}
></Alert>
<Alert
  type='negative'
  clickableText='More Info.'
  onClose={action('Close!')}
  clickableTextProps={{
    onClick: action('Clicked more info!'),
  }}
></Alert>
```

## Sticky Alert

To fix an alert at the top of a user's screen even if they scroll down the page, pass `isSticky` to `<Alert.Wrapper>`. It's important to note that sticky alerts must always be dismissible. Additionally, the alert will appear above all other UI elements except for toast notifications and modals.

<LiveExample src='Alert.sticky.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.AlertStickyExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

It is up to the development team wether or not the sticky alert should push the rest of the content down or not.
