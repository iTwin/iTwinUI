An alert is an element that notifies the user of something important that is not user initiated. If you need to alert the user because of something they did, consider using a [toast](toast) notification or an inline message. Instead, an alert is used to notify the user of something unrelated to what they just did. Examples of this might be announcing a new feature within the product, or alerting the user of scheduled server maintenance and downtime.

## Usage

The alert message must be concise, we recommend no more than 256 characters. If you feel the need to explain in further detail, you may use an optional hyperlink at the end of the alert message to explain more on a new page. You may also include an optional close icon (close icon is required for [sticky](#sticky) alerts).

### Composition API

You can build Alerts with subcomponents that are fully customizable.

We provide:

- Alert.Wrapper
- Alert.Icon
- Alert.Message
- Alert.Action
- Alert.CloseButton

The type of alert can be specified by utilizing the `type` prop inside `<Alert.Wrapper>`. There are four distinct types of alerts that can be chosen from, namely positive, negative, warning, or informational. Positive alerts are an indication that a task or action has been successfully completed, while warning alerts require attention but do not result in any immediate disruption. Negative alerts, however, signify system outages or failures. Informational alerts are intended to provide users with updates on non-disruptive tasks or work.

By passing the `onClick` prop to `<Alert.Action>` or `<Alert.CloseButton>`, the user can interact with the alert to show additional information or to close. A console message can be logged for event response.

<LiveExample src='Alert.types.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.AlertTypesExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Variants

### Sticky Alert

An alert can be fixed at the top of a user's screen, even if they scroll down the page by passing the `isSticky` prop to the `<Alert.Wrapper>` component. It's important to note that sticky alerts must always be dismissible. Additionally, the alert will appear above all other UI elements except for toast notifications and modals.

<LiveExample src='Alert.sticky.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.AlertStickyExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

It is up to the development team wether or not the sticky alert should push the rest of the content down or not.

### Inline

All alerts support inline placement. Inline alerts can optionally be dismissible. Once the alert is dismissed, the content below it will shift upwards due to the alert no longer consuming space.

### Multilines

All alerts may support multiple lines if necessary. We recommend keeping it brief and keep the message as concise as possible.
