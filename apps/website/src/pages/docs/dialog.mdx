<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeMain} />

A dialog informs users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks. Dialogs appear in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

## Types

### Dismissible

A dismissible dialog contains information that is not required to complete before being able to proceed.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeDismissible} />

The dialog can be dismissed multiple different ways:

- Clicking one of the action buttons.
- Clicking on “X” button.
- Pressing the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key on your keyboard.
- Clicking outside the dialog window.

The “X” icon bears the borderless button style which appears on cursor hover.

### Non-dismissible

A non dismissible dialog contains important information that must be completed. The only way to dismiss a non dismissible dialog is by completing the action.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeNonDismissible} />

### Draggable

These dialogs have a defined header that can be clicked and moved around the screen at the user’s leisure, just like a browser window. This dialog can also be resized.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeDraggable} />

### Full page

A full page dialog appears on top of the content and occupy the entire page’s space. It is used primarily for pages where users will customize settings.

<LiveExample src={frontmatter.exampleCodeFullpage} />

The two buttons at the bottom right are always pinned in that same area, regardless of content. If there is more content than there is available space in the content area, a scrollbar can be included to make the content area scrollable.

As specified earlier, full-page dialogs will house various settings options as shown in the example below.

## Usage guidelines

Do:

- Use dialogs for important warnings, as a way to prevent or correct critical errors.
- Simplify the workflow. Use dialogs to ask for information that, when provided, could significantly lessen users’ work or effort.
- Limit the dialog to a single purpose. Limit the interaction to one, straightforward task.
- Keep it short. Be brief and concise in your content.
- Try displaying your information in a different way. See alternatives for more information.

Don't:

- Open a dialog from a dialog.
- Have multiple steps within a dialog.
- Present dialogs unless prompted by the user.
- Use a login within a dialog windows. You can’t link to them and some password managers can’t pre-fill them because the dialogs are hidden.

Here are other ways to display information if a dialog is deemed inadequate for the context, but an important message still needs to be passed onto the user.

### Alternative options

Dialogs can easily be misused or overused. Here are some alternative options to consider:

- Present your content **inline** to be less disruptive, such as the message underneath an [input](input).
- Use **expanding elements** such as the [expandable block](expandableblock), [tooltips](tooltip), or the [information panel](informationpanel).
- Lead the user to a **different page** to isolate the interaction without losing access to functionality such as navigation.
- Inform the user with a **less intrusive notification** such as a [toast](toast). Toasts are less intrusive and are preferred to a dialog for interactions such as undoing an action.
