A dialog informs users about a task and can contain critical information, require decisions, or involve multiple tasks. Dialogs appear in front of app content to provide critical information or ask for a decision. Dialogs disable all app functionality when they appear, and remain on screen until confirmed, dismissed, or a required action has been taken.

Dialogs are purposefully interruptive, so they should be used sparingly.

## Anatomy

- Title: must be descriptive of the task at hand. The user must understand the context because they went from the main window to a dialog.
- Close button: only allowed in dismissible dialogs.
- Content
- Actions: see Button standard for best practices.
- Box & shadow
- Overlay: Dialog appears above all other UI elements and casts a black overlay as well as a drop shadow on all other content, creating a strong visual focus on the dialog.

The dialog should be located in the upper half of the screen, because on smaller screens it may get lost. A dialog’s maximum width is 50% of the screen width & the minimum width is 400px. If your content can not fit inside the dialog without scrollbars, you should consider alternative ways to display the information.

When the 400px minimum width conflicts with the 50% maximum of the screen width, then the dialog spans the entire width of the device. This mobile dialog can span the entire height of the screen but should not use scroll bars.

## Types

### Dismissible dialogs

A dismissible dialog contains information that is not required. The dialog can be dismissed multiple different ways:

- Clicking one of the action buttons.
- Clicking on “X” button.
- Pressing the ESC key on your keyboard.
- Clicking elsewhere outside the dialog window.

The “X” icon bears the borderless button style which appears on cursor hover.

### Non dismissible dialogs

A non dismissible dialog contains important information that must be completed. The only way to dismiss a non dismissible dialog is by completing the action.

### Drag-enabled dialogs

These dialogs have a definite header that can be clicked and moved around the screen at the user’s leisure, just like a browser window.

### Full page dialogs

A full page dialog appears on top of the content and occupy the entire page’s space. It is used primarily for pages where users will customize settings.

The two buttons at the bottom right are always pinned in that same area, regardless of content. If there is more content than there is available space in the content area, a scrollbar can be included to make the content area scrollable.

As specified earlier, full-page dialogs will house various settings options as shown in the example below.

## Usage guidelines

### Dos & Don'ts

Do:

- Use dialogs for important warnings, as a way to prevent or correct critical errors.
- Simplify the workflow. Use dialogs to ask for information that, when provided, could significantly lessen users’ work or effort.
- Limit the dialog to a single purpose. Limit the interaction to one, straightforward task.
- Keep it short. Be brief and concise in your content.
- Try displaying your information in a different way. See alternatives for more information.

Don't:

- Open a dialog from a dialog.
- Have multiple steps within a dialog.
- Present dialogs unless prompted by the user.
- Use a login within a dialog windows. You can’t link to them and some password managers can’t pre-fill them because the dialogs are hidden.

### Alternative ways to display the information

Here are other ways to display information if a dialog is deemed inadequate for the context, but an important message still needs to be passed onto the user.

#### Inline

Present your content inline to be less disruptive. You can read more about inline errors within the Text Field standard.

#### Expanding elements

Use expanding elements such as the expandable block, toolbars, tooltips, or a side bar such as the information panel.

#### New page

Lead the user to a different page to isolate the interaction without losing access to functionality such as navigation.

#### Undo patterns

Instead of using a confirmation dialog, consider using toast notifications to speed up the user’s interaction. Toast notifications are less intrusive and are preferred to a dialog for interactions such as undoing an action.
