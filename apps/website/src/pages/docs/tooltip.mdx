A tooltip is a small container that typically appears above the element you are hovering with your cursor with a short, helpful text message.

## Usage

You can use up to 256 characters. Content other than text such as pictures, tables, etc, are not recommended. Mobile devices does not have a hover state, caution when using tooltips in desktop apps that have a mobile counterpart. There is no determined way of replacing tooltips in mobile devices.

Examples of many ways tooltip can be use in [Avatar](avatar#overflow) group, [Stepper](stepper#tooltip), and [Slider](slider#tooltips).

It is not recommended to use tooltips to display critical information, or as a means to navigate an interface. They are necessary only when supplemental information is required. Functionality of the product should NOT be dependent on the user reading tooltips.

Tooltips are enabled by default but can be turned off.

Tooltips can also be customized such as changing the placement or the information that is displayed within it.
