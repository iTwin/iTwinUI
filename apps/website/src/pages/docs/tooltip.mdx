A tooltip is a small container that typically appears above the element you are hovering with your cursor with a short, helpful text message. You can use up to 256 characters. Content other than text such as pictures, tables, etc, are not recommended.

Is it not recommended not to use Tooltips to display critical information, or as a means to navigate an interface. They are necessary only when supplemental information is required. Functionality of the product should NOT be dependent on the user reading the tooltips.

Mobile devices do not have a hover state, use with caution when using tooltips in desktop apps that have a mobile counterpart. There is no determined way of replacing tooltips in mobile devices. In some cases, a single short tap can display a tooltip on a touch display.
