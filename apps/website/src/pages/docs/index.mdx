## Installation

```shell
npm install @itwin/itwinui-react
```

```shell
yarn add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

## Usage

Import the component you want and start using it!

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

## Theming

By default, all components use the light theme but we also provide support for switching to dark theme in two different ways:

- Use ThemeProvider in your root component where you can pass one of the following values:

  - light (default)
  - dark
  - os (which respects the color scheme of the operating system)

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <ThemeProvider theme='dark' />
    // Your code goes here.
  </>
);
```

- The useTheme hook also provides the same functionality as ThemeProvider.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => {
  useTheme('dark');
  return <>/* Your code goes here.*/</>;
};
```

_Note: You only need to use one of these methods, and it only needs to be done once._
