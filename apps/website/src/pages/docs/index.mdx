## Installation

```shell
npm install @itwin/itwinui-react
```

```shell
yarn add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

## Usage

Import the component you want and start using it!

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

## Theming

By default, all components use the light theme, but we recommend wrapping your root element with `ThemeProvider`. You can pass one of the following values to its `theme` prop:

- `light` (default)
- `dark`
- `os` (which respects the color scheme of the operating system)

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <ThemeProvider theme='dark'>
      <>{/* Your components go here. */}</>
    </ThemeProvider>
  </>
);
```
