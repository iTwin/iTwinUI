The color picker is extremely flexible. Bits and pieces can be used based on product requirements. If certain parts are not required for your context, they can be left out.

There is no hard guidelines for what an advanced color picker contains. The point is that it remains usable and aligns with the user’s workflow. If you are unsure about a product’s use of the color picker, contact a member of the visual team for advice.
