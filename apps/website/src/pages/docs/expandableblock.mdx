<Placeholder componentPageName='core-expandableblock' />

<LiveExample src='ExpandableBlock.main.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.ExpandableBlockMainExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The expandable block has a label reflecting its content. On click, it expands to reveal more content.

## Variants

### With caption

<LiveExample src='ExpandableBlock.withcaption.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.ExpandableBlockWithCaptionExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

Users can optionally display descriptor text underneath the title.

### Accordion

<LiveExample src='ExpandableBlock.accordion.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.ExpandableBlockAccordionExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

NEEDS CAPTION

### With status

<LiveExample src='ExpandableBlock.status.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.ExpandableBlockStatusExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

An expandable block could display status, a total count, or other helpful information at a glance right aligned within the block header.

### Small

<LiveExample src='ExpandableBlock.small.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.ExpandableBlockSmallExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

NEEDS CAPTION

### Borderless

<LiveExample src='ExpandableBlock.borderless.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.ExpandableBlockBorderlessExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Usage

- Expandable blocks are used to progressively disclose information. [Read this article to learn more about progressive disclosure.](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/progressive-disclosure/)

- Expandable blocks should not be used with flattened hierarchy or information panels.

### Forms

Expandable blocks are used in pages to divide up content in sections, in forms for example. If each section has many fields, using expandable blocks will help alleviate the UI and prevent the user from scrolling endlessly to get to the section they are looking for.

### Expandable blocks VS [hierarchy tree](tree)

While these two patterns may appear similar, they both fulfill a different role and are not interchangeable. Here are some tips to determine if an expandable block is what you need.

Use an expandable blocks when:

- You have a page with different sections all containing user-generated content that would benefit from being split up;
- There is only one level of indentation possible at all times;
- The content you want to be expandable varies from simple list items to more complex form components (such as text fields, buttons, etc.).

Use a hierarchy tree when:

- You require a pattern that works with several levels of data (folder drilling);
- There are only list items in the pattern;
- The hierarchy is not necessarily linear and may branch out.
