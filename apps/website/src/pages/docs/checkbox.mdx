A checkbox (or tickbox) is a form component allowing multiple options selection. It serves a similar purpose than the radio button, the main difference being that radio buttons only permits binary option selection.

Checkboxes are usually accompanied by a label. They can be used either for selecting one or more options in a list, or to enable, disable, show, or hide a feature in the UI. It should however not be confused with a toggle switch, which has a similar role but is not appropriate in all settings. To learn more about when to use a toggle switch or a checkbox, please read [Checkbox vs Toggle Switch by Saadia Minhas](https://uxplanet.org/checkbox-vs-toggle-switch-7fc6e83f10b8).

A checkbox is not interchangeable with a radio button. A radio button must have at minimum 2 choice options, almost always has one option pre-selected, and cannot have several options selected at once. A checkbox, however, can be checked and unchecked at will, and can be displayed as standalone or in a group of two or more.
