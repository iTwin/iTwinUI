When a user needs to schedule deadlines, timeframes, or for age verification purposes, we provide them with a date picker. It behaves much like a select menu. We currently have three different types of date pickers.

## Appearance

### Default

The default date picker is a default menu button from which an interactive calendar expands on click. This allows the user to visually select the date rather than entering the date with a keyboard. This has the advantage of also showing weekdays, which may be important in a given context. The date picker is commonly used within column filters.

### Text field

There are two ways to select a date with the text field date picker; clicking on the button and selecting a date, or typing it out using the format shown in the help message underneath the field (DD-MM-YYYY). The date automatically fills the text field when directly selected in the calendar and is editable. It’s a more convenient way to offer editing in a context where the user might need to change the date often, or enter different dates for several items in a workflow.

### Inline

The inline date picker was styled to be used in forms. The horizontally centered label helps the component belong in a form without breaking the flow.

### With time

If you need to include the time, there are multiple ways to do so. If it is only required to select a time within 15 minute increments, it is suggested to combine the time picker with the date picker.

You may choose to display the time in military format and exclude the period picker.

If the user needs the ability to enter a specific time, we suggest displaying the time within it’s own select menu within close proximity of the date picker. The user can select a time from the dropdown menu or manually enter a specific time.

### Date spans

There may be some cases where you need to display a span of dates. When this occurs, the selection box spans the entirety of the date span.

### Year skipping

To improve user experience, date pickers support year skipping buttons. Clicking on the double chevron icon will move the calendar a full year forward or back.
