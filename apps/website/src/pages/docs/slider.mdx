Sliders allow the user to graphically select a specific input value, or a range, within defined limits. Optionally, a [tooltip](tooltip) appears above the slider handle to indicate the current value and changes as the slider handle is repositioned. The sliders min, max, and step values can be changed as needed. To help visually enforce incremental steps, you may optionally choose to display ticks underneath the slider. The slider can be oriented horizontally or vertically.

Changes made with sliders should be immediate, allowing a user to make slider adjustments until finding their preference. This means a setting controlled by a slider should not require to be validated by clicking a button for the changes to be applied.

## Variants

### Default

Use the default slider in most situations, when a simple gradation between numerical values is required. Numerical gradation between the two absolute values is optional.

### Range

<LiveExample src='Slider.range.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderRangeExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The range sliders should be used when the desired input is a range such as 25 through 75.

<LiveExample src='Slider.rangemultiple.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderRangeMultipleExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

You can have multiple ranges and can also have the range wrap.

### Vertical

<LiveExample src='Slider.vertical.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderVerticalExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The slider can be displayed horizontally (default) or vertically.

## Usage

Sliders reflect a range of values along a bar, from which users may select a single value. They are ideal for adjusting settings such as volume, brightness, or applying image filters.

### Immediate effect

Changes made with sliders are immediate, allowing a user to make slider adjustments until finding their preference. This means a setting controlled by a slider should not require to be validated by clicking a button for the changes to be applied. They shouldnâ€™t be paired with settings that have even minor delays in providing user feedback.

### Current state

Sliders reflect the current state of the settings they control.

### Labels & steps

<LiveExample src='Slider.labels.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderLabelsExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

You can display min / max labels as text or icons and can optionally enable tick labels underneath the slider. You can also have the value jump by a certain amount of steps - in this example it jumps by `10`. To have more finer control, the jump can be changed to a decimal such as `0.5`.

### Custom thumb

<LiveExample src='Slider.thumbcustom.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderThumbCustomExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

The thumb can be customized if desired.

### Tooltips

<LiveExample src='Slider.tooltipnone.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderTooltipNoneExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

Tooltips are enabled by default but can be turned off.

<LiveExample src='Slider.tooltipcustom.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.SliderTooltipCustomExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

Tooltips can also be customized such as changing the placement or the information that is displayed within it.
