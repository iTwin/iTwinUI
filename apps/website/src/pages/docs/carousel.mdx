The Carousel component consists of a set of slides, normally displayed one at a time. A navigation section is
located below the slides, consisting of "dots" and "previous"/"next" buttons, used for changing slides.

The currently shown slide can also be changed using the left/right arrow keys or by dragging on a touch device.

This component uses a composition approach so it should be used with the provided subcomponents.
