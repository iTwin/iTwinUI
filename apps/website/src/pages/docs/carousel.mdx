The Carousel component consists of a set of slides, normally displayed one at a time. A navigation section is located below the slides, consisting of ["dots"](#dots-list) and ["previous"/"next"](#navigation) buttons, used for changing slides.

## Usage

### Controlled State

By default, the carousel maintains its own state. But it can also be controlled externally using `activeSlideIndex` and `onSlideChange`.

<LiveExample src='Carousel.controlled.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.CarouselControlledExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Subcomponents

Carousel exposes the following subcomponents. The usage of all subcomponents is not mandatory; some of them (e.g. `Carousel.Navigation`) will automatically include recommended children and props by default.

### Carousel.Slider

`Carousel.Slider` is the scrollable list that should consist of `Carousel.Slide` components.

### Carousel.Slide

`Carousel.Slide` is used for the actual slide content. The content can be specified through `children`. It is recommended that the slide content bring its own dimensions (esp. height) and that the dimensions should be the same for all slides.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselSlide.d.ts'} />

### Carousel.Navigation

The `Carousel.Navigation` component by default consists of the `PreviousButton` and `NextButton` shown on the left and right and the `Carousel.DotsList` component shown in the middle. `children` can be specified to override what is shown in this navigation section.

**Important**: The navigation section must always be present before the slides in DOM order.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselNavigation.d.ts'} />

### Carousel.DotsList

The `Carousel.DotsList` component shows a list of `Carousel.Dot` components which can be used to choose a specific slide. If used as a descendant of `Carousel`, then this component does not need any props or `children`. The props can be specified if this component is being used outside `Carousel`. `children` can be specified to override the individual dots that are shown.

**Important**: When used standalone, this component must always be present before the slides in DOM order. It is also important to pay close attention to [accessibility](#accessibility), since you may be missing some parts that make the carousel pattern complete. For this reason, we do not recommend diverging from the standard usage unless you have a very strong need and are confident that you can implement it accessibly.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselDotsList.d.ts'} />

### Carousel.Dot

`Carousel.Dot` is the actual "dot" component used to activate a slide on clicking. It should be used as a child of `Carousel.Dots`.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselDot.d.ts'} />

## Accessibility

The `Carousel` component is built with accessibility in mind and tested to work well with different input modalities. It includes support for keyboard users and touch-screen users.

The component is loosely based on the [APG Tabs pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/tabs/), where the dots are considered to be "tabs" and the slides are considered to be "panels". For this reason, it is important that the dots (navigation section) is present before the slides in DOM order.

When a slide is changed, all inactive slides will become ["inert"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Global_attributes/inert) so that they cannot be interacted with by users of assistive technology.

Lastly, the carousel does not support auto-rotating slides, because that can lead to many different [accessibility](https://www.boia.org/blog/carousels-and-accessibility-7-tips) and [usability](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/auto-forwarding/) issues. We do _not_ recommend implementing your own auto-rotating carousel unless you have done extensive research and testing with users (including users with disabilities).
