The Carousel component consists of a set of slides, normally displayed one at a time. A navigation section is located below the slides, consisting of ["dots"](#dots-list) and ["previous"/"next"](#navigation) buttons, used for changing slides.

<PropsTable path={frontmatter.propsPath} />

## Usage

### Controlled State

By default, the carousel maintains its own state. But it can also be controlled externally using `activeSlideIndex` and `onSlideChange`.

<LiveExample src='Carousel.controlled.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.CarouselControlledExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Only Dots

`Carousel.DotsList` can be used without the `Carousel` component. Here is an example to demonstrate this where clicking on the right/left half of the slide will go one slide forward/backward.

<LiveExample src='Carousel.onlyDots.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.CarouselOnlyDotsExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Subcomponents

This component uses a composition approach, similar to most of the other components. The usage of all subcomponents is not mandatory. We have taken extra care to reduce verbosity while designing the Carousel API.

### Carousel.Slider

`Carousel.Slider` is the scrollable list that should consist of `Carousel.Slide` components.

### Carousel.Slide

`Carousel.Slide` is used for the actual slide content. The content can be specified through `children`. It is recommended that the slide content bring its own dimensions (esp. height) and that the dimensions should be the same for all slides.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselSlide.d.ts'} />

### Carousel.Navigation

The `Carousel.Navigation` component by default consists of the `PreviousButton` and `NextButton` shown on the left and right and the `Carousel.DotsList` component shown in the middle. `children` can be specified to override what is shown in this navigation section.

**Important**: The navigation section must always be present before the slides in DOM order.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselNavigation.d.ts'} />

### Carousel.DotsList

The `Carousel.DotsList` component shows a list of `Carousel.Dot` components which can be used to choose a specific slide. If used as a descendant of `Carousel`, then this component does not need any props or `children`. The props can be specified if this component is being used outside `Carousel`. `children` can be specified to override the individual dots that are shown.

**Important**: When used standalone, this component must always be present before the slides in DOM order.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselDotsList.d.ts'} />

### Carousel.Dot

`Carousel.Dot` is the actual "dot" component used to activate a slide on clicking. It should be used as a child of `Carousel.Dots`.

<PropsTable path={'@itwin/itwinui-react/esm/core/Carousel/CarouselDot.d.ts'} />

## Accessibility

The `Carousel` component is designed to provide visually appealing user interface for users with disabilities. Users can navigate through the carousel using the arrow keys (Left/Right) or by dragging on a touch screen device.
