Tags are user-generated keywords used to label, categorize, or organize items and files. A group of multiple tags is a standard way of labeling an item to make it easily discoverable by peers who may not know the exact title of said item. A single tag may be mapped to more than one project at once if these projects fit in similar categories. Tags may also be used as a way to filter out content; in that context, the tags are pre-existing, and users select tags that fit their search to narrow down the results.
