The first thing most people look at when they arrive at a new web page is the header. It is usually stuck at the top of the page. The header contains vital information about your company's name and function, as well as the purpose of the specific page.

## Usage

The main `<header>` compnent is consisted of various subcomponents and can be customized accordingly by modifying its props.

- Logo can be added using the `appLogo` prop and specifying the desired logo under the `<HeaderLogo>` subcomponent.
- Breadcrumbs trail can be implemented using the `breadcrumbs` prop and `<HeaderBreadcrumbs>` subcomponent. Individual buttons can be added within the breadcrumbs trail using the `<HeaderButton>` subcomponent, allowing users to interact. For the dropdown menu, the `menuItems` prop can be used inside the `<HeaderButton>` for showing items and `onClick()` properties for handling actions.
- Buttons/Icons/Content can be displayed towards the left of menuitems using the `actions` prop.

## Customizations

Alter standard header section by adding new custom elements and content.

### Full Header

Have default header with additional items.

<LiveExample src='Header.full.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.HeaderFullExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

### Slim Header

Make header slim using `isSlim` property. This can be used when working in a 3D environment.

<LiveExample src='Header.slim.tsx'>
  <AllExamples.HeaderSlimExample client:load />
</LiveExample>

## Accessibility

For accessibility reasons, certain users strictly use their keyboard for navigating digital interfaces. We need to ensure the header doesn’t get in the way of these users every time they want to access a page’s main content. To make their experience more efficient, include a Skip to main content link to allow keyboard users to bypass the navigation header and skip directly to the page’s content.

Without such a link, keyboard users will need to tab through the entire header every time they land on a new page. This makes their experience tedious and time-consuming. For more information, read the Skip to main content article, and check out the Skip to main content component.
