In defined, multi-step user interactions, it is useful to inform the user of the number of steps involved in the process, and the current step within that sequence. A UI 'Stepper' guides the user through the steps and provides some interaction to return to previous steps. A standard example of a Stepper would be an e-Commerce checkout process, but there are many others where the user must perform sequential steps.
