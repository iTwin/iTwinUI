A select is a control element meant to allow the user to select an option from a list. Depending on type, it is either visible at all times (permanent) or only if the user triggers it by clicking an element or right-clicking (temporary).

There are select menus that are called ‘temporary’; they appear as fully expanded and do not possess a collapsed state. Instead of collapsing and expanding, they are dismissed from the interface by clicking away. They may reappear only when the user triggers them again, either by right-clicking or clicking an item associated with it.
