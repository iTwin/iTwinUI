A radio button unlike checkboxes, permit selection of a single item within a set. Use radio buttons when the user is required to make a choice in a list with only one selection allowed. For example, a list where the user can only answer with yes or no.

A radio is not interchangeable with a [checkbox](checkbox). A radio must have at minimum 2 choice options and only one option can be checked. A checkbox, however, can have as many or as few items checked, and can be displayed as standalone or within a group of two or more.
