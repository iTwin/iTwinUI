## What is iTwinUI-react?

iTwinUI-react is a library built on top of the [iTwinUI](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI) library.
The goal of this project is to provide React components for using the styles and components from the core `iTwinUI` project.

## Installation

```
npm install @itwin/itwinui-react
```

```
yarn add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

## Usage

Import the component you want and start using it!

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

Yes, that's really all you need as you can see in this live interactive demo:

[![Edit Button](https://codesandbox.io/static/img/play-codesandbox.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/itwinui-react-minimal-example-xq2t3)

## Theming

By default, all components use the light theme but we also provide support for switching to dark theme in two different ways:

- Use `ThemeProvider` in your root component where you can pass one of the following values:
  - `light` (default)
  - `dark`
  - `os` (which respects the color scheme of the operating system)

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <ThemeProvider theme='dark' />
    // Your code goes here.
  </>
);
```

- The `useTheme` hook also provides the same functionality as `ThemeProvider`.

```jsx
import { useTheme } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => {
  useTheme('dark');
  return <>// Your code goes here.</>;
};
```

_Note: You only need to use one of these methods, and it only needs to be done once._
