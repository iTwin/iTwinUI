## What is iTwinUI-react?

iTwinUI-react is a React component library for [iTwinUI](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI).
The goal of this project is to provide React components that make it easier to use the styles from [`@itwin/itwinui-css`](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/tree/main/packages/itwinui-css). Check out the [demo website](https://itwin.github.io/iTwinUI-react) to see the components in action.

## Installation

```
npm install @itwin/itwinui-react
```

```
yarn add @itwin/itwinui-react
```

## Usage

Import the component you want and start using it!

```jsx
import { Button } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => <Button>Hello!</Button>;
```

Yes, that's really all you need as you can see in this live interactive demo:

[![Edit in CodeSandbox](https://assets.codesandbox.io/github/button-edit-lime.svg)](https://codesandbox.io/s/github/iTwin/iTwinUI/tree/main/playgrounds/cra?file=/src/App.jsx)

## Theming

By default, all components use the light theme, but we recommend wrapping your root element with `ThemeProvider`. You can pass one of the following values to its `theme` prop:

- `light` (default)
- `dark`
- `os` (which respects the color scheme of the operating system)

```jsx
import { ThemeProvider } from '@itwin/itwinui-react';

const App = () => (
  <>
    <ThemeProvider theme='dark'>
      {/* Your components go here. */}
    </ThemeProvider>
  </>
);
```
