Added a new generic `unstable_Panels` component for easy setup of nested screens/panels. Example uses: multi-layered menus, wizards, settings screens, etc.
 - This API is temporarily marked as **unstable** to collect [feedback](https://github.com/iTwin/iTwinUI/discussions/2348) for some time to tailor the generic component specifically to users' needs.
