Updated `ExpandableBlock` to support customizable subcomponents: `<ExpandableBlock.Wrapper/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.Trigger/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.ExpandIcon/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.LabelArea/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.Title/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.Caption/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.EndIcon/>`, `<ExpandableBlock.Content/>`

The old api is still supported for backwards compatibility.
