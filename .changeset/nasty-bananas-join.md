Aggregated a subset of CSS styles across some field components: `Button`, `Input`, `TextArea`, and `Select`, in order to reduce the CSS and improve visual consistency. Some resulting changes:
  * `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select` have a similar hover state as `Button`.
  * `Input`, `Textarea`, and `Select` now show their value as greyed out when disabled.
