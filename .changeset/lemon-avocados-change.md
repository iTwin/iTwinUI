All `<a>` elements will now need to have the `iui-anchor` class in order to be styled with iTwinUI's standard link styling. Classes that previously provided these styles will no longer provide them. These effected classes are `iui-alert-link`, `iui-breadcrumbs-content`, `iui-tag-basic`, and `iui-toast-anchor`. Additionally, all `<a>` elements within `iui-legal-footer` elements will need the `iui-anchor` class.
