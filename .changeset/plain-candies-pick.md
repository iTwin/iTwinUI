Visual changes to tabs for better accessibility and appearance when in theme bridge mode.

- Default tabs focus `outline-offset` inset more so to not obstruct the active tab stripe.
- Dividing line between borderless tabs and content area reduced to `1px` to give the active tab stripe a visual difference.
- Active borderless tab no longer has `background-color` change.
- Tab description / sublabel has `color` change with `transition`.
