`.iui-table-body-extra` is a new class that can be added as a sibling after `.iui-table-body` to hold extra content after `.iui-table-body` and before the `.iui-table-paginator`. `.iui-table-body-extra` + `data-iui-loading="true"` makes the content sticky on the `inline-start`, which is useful for showing something like a loading spinner in the center, regardless of the horizontal scroll position.
