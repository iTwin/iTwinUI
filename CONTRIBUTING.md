## How to setup

To clone and build iTwinUI, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node 16](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), and [Yarn 1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) installed on your computer.

1. [Create a local clone](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo#cloning-your-forked-repository) of your forked repository. You can do this from the command line or using the Github Desktop app.
2. Go to the directory where you cloned iTwinUI. e.g. `cd iTwinUI`.
3. Run `yarn install` from that directory.

## Developing

### Monorepo overview

We use [Turborepo](https://turborepo.org/) as our monorepo tool to improve the experience of [yarn workspaces](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/workspaces/). It allows running commands in parallel and caches build outputs.

The root package.json includes a few commands that use `turbo run` to run the corresponding command in all workspaces.

e.g. to build all workspaces together, run the following command from the root:

```
yarn build
```

#### Development environment

To start the development server for all workspaces, run the following command from the root.
```
yarn dev
```

This will automatically build anything that's not already built, and run the `dev` script for every workspace in parallel, watching for file changes.

By default, a portal will be opened containing links to all the different dev servers:
  - docs website:  `http://localhost:1700`
  - vite playground: `http://localhost:1701`
  - next playground: `http://localhost:1702`
  - astro playground: `http://localhost:1703`
  - storybook: `http://localhost:6006` (storybook default)
  - html test pages: `http://localhost:5173` (vite default)

If you only need to run this task for a specific workspace, you can specify turborepo's `--filter` argument. For example, if you only want to start storybook, you could run `yarn dev --filter=storybook`.

### Running bespoke commands

If a script is not available in the root package.json or if you need to pass workspace-specific cli args, then you can specify the workspace as follows:
```
# passing Alert as a cli arg to the `test` command in itwinui-react
yarn workspace @itwin/itwinui-react test Alert
```

...or you can simply run the command normally from inside the workspace folder instead of the monorepo root.
```
# run this from inside packages/itwinui-react/ for the same result
yarn test Alert
```

Note that this bypasses the turborepo pipeline, so you will need to manually run any dependent tasks first. For example, if the `build` command of `storybook` relies on the `build` command of `@itwin/itwinui-react`, then you will need to manually run the `build` commands in the right order.
```
yarn workspace @itwin/itwinui-react build
yarn workspace storybook build
```

This is why it's recommended to use the turbo `--filter` syntax whenever possible.
```
yarn build --filter=storybook
```

### Adding a new component

If you'd like to get your component added to iTwinUI, follow these guidelines.

We provide a script that can automatically create all the necessary files for you. Simply run `yarn createComponent [component-name]` (e.g. `yarn createComponent my-component`).

- Add all your component styles in `src/[component-name]/[component-name].scss` file.
  - Break variables and mixins into separate files where possible.
  - Use existing Sass variables for spacing (margin, padding, sizing, etc).
- Define classes for your mixin in `src/[component-name]/classes.scss` file.
  - _Running the `createComponent` command will do this for you._
- Make sure your component index and classes are imported in `src/all.scss`.
  - _Running the `createComponent` command will also do this for you but you need to manually sort the imports alphabetically._
- Write tests for your new component in `backstop/tests/[component-name].html` and `backstop/scenarios/[component-name].js`. See [Testing](#Testing) section below.
- After running `yarn build` you can open minified html in browser to check up, how your component looks like from `backstop/minified`.

### Testing

#### How to run tests:

For running tests you will need [Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop). It helps to avoid cross-platform rendering differences.

- Make sure Docker is running.

- To run tests for a specific component, use this command:

  `yarn test --filter=[component_name]` (e.g. `yarn test --filter=side-navigation`)

- To approve test images, run `yarn approve`.

- To delete old/unused tests images, run `yarn clean:images`.

#### How to write tests:

- Write the html in `backstop/tests/[component-name].html` displaying the elements you wish to test and their all possible states, using the built CSS in `lib/css/`.

- Write the test cases in `backstop/scenarios/[component-name].js` and ensure it exports scenarios list (see `backstop/scenarios/alert.js` for example).
  - Use `scenario` function from `scenarioHelper.js` to create a scenario where the first argument is test case name and the second one is options.
    ```js
    const { scenario } = require('../scenarioHelper');
    module.exports = [scenario('basic')];
    ```
  - For actions like click, hover use according functions from `scenarioHelper.js` and pass them as scenario options `actions` property.
    ```js
    const { scenario, hover } = require('../scenarioHelper');
    module.exports = [scenario('hover', { actions: [hover('.element-selector')] })];
    ```
  - If you want to select only specific part of the test elements, pass `selectors` property to the options.
    ```js
    const { scenario } = require('../scenarioHelper');
    module.exports = [scenario('selected part', { selectors: ['.selected-part-selector'] })];
    ```
  - If you want to hide some elements because they might be moving e.g. spinner, pass `hideSelectors` property to the options.
    ```js
    const { scenario } = require('../scenarioHelper');
    module.exports = [scenario('hide part', { hideSelectors: ['.hide-selector'] })];
    ```
  - More information about options can be found in [BackstopJS GitHub](https://github.com/garris/BackstopJS#advanced-scenarios).

### Creating components

Before developing, please read our [style guide](./STYLEGUIDE.md).

If you are creating a new component, use this script:

`yarn createComponent`

It ensures all needed imports are added and files are created.

> Note: Every component needs to use `useTheme()` hook to ensure styling (theming) works fine. The `createComponent` script mentioned above adds it automatically.

For a component named `Alert`, the `createComponent` script will add/modify the following files:

<details>
<summary>Directory structure</summary>

```
packages/itwinui-css
|
| - src
|   |
|   + - alert
|       + - > alert.scss
|       + - > classes.scss
|       + - > index.scss
|
| - backstop
|   |
|   + - tests
|       + - > alert.html
|
packages/itwinui-react
|
| - src
|   |
|   + - core
|       |
|       + - Alert
|       |   + - > Alert.test.tsx
|       |   + - > Alert.tsx
|       |   + - > index.ts
|       |
|       + - > index.ts
|
apps/storybook
|   |
|   + - src
|       |
|       + - > Alert.stories.tsx
|.      + - > Alert.test.ts
```

</details>

packages/itwinui-css/src/**alert/alert.scss**
  - Contains the framework-agnostic styling for the component

packages/itwinui-css/backstop/tests/**alert.html**
  - Contains all the test cases and demonstrations for the framework-agnostic css.

export default './Alert';
```

packages/itwinui-react/src/core/**index.ts**

```jsx
---
export { Alert } from './Alert';

### Importing icons

#### In `packages/itwinui-react`:

* Manually add the `<svg>` component to `utils/icons` and `utils/icons/index.ts`
* Import it from `utils`

e.g.
```tsx
import { SvgClose, SvgInfoCircular } from '../utils';
```

#### In other modules:

* Import it from `@itwin/itwinui-icons-react`

e.g.
```tsx
import { SvgChevronRightDouble, SvgFolder } from '@itwin/itwinui-icons-react';
```

### Documentation

We use [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) (not TSDoc) to write documentation for our code.

Every component should have a multiline description and at least one example.

```jsx
/**
 * A small box to quickly grab user attention and communicate a brief message.
 * @example
 * <Alert>This is a basic alert.</Alert>
 */
export const Alert = (props: AlertProps) => {
  ...
```

Examples can be captioned. This is especially helpful when there are multiple examples.

```jsx
/**
 * Footer element with all needed legal and info links.
 * Be sure to place it manually at the bottom of your page.
 * You can use position 'absolute' with relative body or set the height of the content and place footer at the end.
 * @example <caption>Appending custom element after default elements</caption>
 * <Footer customElements={[{title: 'Bentley', url: 'https://www.bentley.com/'}]} />
 * @example <caption>Returning only custom elements</caption>
 * <Footer customElements={() => newFooterElements)} />
 ...
 */
export const Footer = (props: FooterProps) => {
  ...
```

Every prop should have a multiline description with relevant informational tags.

```jsx
export type AlertProps = {
  /**
   * Type of the alert.
   * @default 'informational'
   */
  type?: 'positive' | 'warning' | 'negative' | 'informational';
 /**
   * Action handler for the clickable text.
   * @deprecated `clickableTextProps` should be used instead.
   */
  onClick?: () => void;
  ...
```

More examples can be found in the [style guide](./STYLEGUIDE.md).

### Unit Testing

Each component has a corresponding jest test inside of its directory. Be sure to cover your added code with tests.

Use `yarn test` to run the tests. Add `--watch` flag if you want tests to rerun after changes.

We usually do not use `describe` block and our test case should start with 'should'.

```jsx
it('should be visible', () => {
  const { getByText } = render(
    <Tooltip parentId='container' content='some text' isVisible>
      <div>Visible!</div>
    </Tooltip>,
  );

  getByText('some text');
});
```

### Visual Testing

We reuse our stories for visual tests by taking screenshots of the story iframes in [Cypress](https://cypress.io/).

#### Running visual tests

1. Make sure you have [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started) installed and running.
2. From the monorepo root, run `yarn test --filter=storybook`. This will build storybook and run all cypress tests in docker.
   -  If you only need to run tests for a specific component, you can do so by passing the `--spec` argument to cypress. e.g. for testing `Alert`, you can run `yarn workspace storybook test --spec="**/Alert.*"`. Don't forget to build storybook first (yarn build --filter=storybook).
3. Once the tests finish running, you can approve any failing test images using `yarn workspace storybook test:approve`.

#### Writing visual tests

Inside the `apps/storybook` workspace, the `src/` directory has a set of `-.stories.tsx` files, each of which is accompanied by a `-.test.ts` file. Here's what a typical test file should look like:

```ts
describe('Alert', () => {
  const storyPath = 'Core/Alert';
  const tests = [
    'Positive',
    'Negative',
    'Warning',
    'Informational',
  ];

  tests.forEach((testName) => {
    it(testName, () => {
      const id = Cypress.storyId(storyPath, testName);
      cy.visit('iframe', { qs: { id } });
      cy.compareSnapshot(testName);
    });
  });
});
```

Notice how we do all of these things manually:
- defining the names of all the stories that need to be tested and excluding the ones that don't.
- specifying the story iframe url using the custom `storyId` helper.
- visiting the iframe using `cy.visit`.
- taking and comparing the screenshot using `cy.compareSnapshot` from [`cypress-image-diff-js`](https://github.com/uktrade/cypress-image-diff).

We have full access to the [Cypress API](https://docs.cypress.io/api) so any additional interactions or custom logic can be easily added.
